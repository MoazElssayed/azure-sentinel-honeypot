# azure-sentinel-honeypot
Azure Sentinel honeypot and SOC detection lab simulating real-world attacksazure
This repository documents my hands-on lab project where I deployed a **honeypot environment in Azure** and integrated it with **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)** to detect and visualize attacks.

Inspired by: [joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab), but extended with my own detections, workbooks, and SOC-style analysis.

##  Project Overview
- Deployed **Windows & Linux honeypot VMs** in Microsoft Azure.  
- Configured **Data Collection Rules (DCR)** and **AMA agents** to stream logs into **Log Analytics Workspace**.  
- Integrated with **Microsoft Sentinel** to monitor, detect, and respond to threats.  
- Built **custom analytics rules** in KQL to detect:
  - Brute Force Attempts (Windows & Linux)
  - Privilege Escalation & Role Assignments (Azure AD / Entra ID)
  - Firewall Tampering
  - Malware Detection Events
  - Triggered **incidents & alerts** mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics (Credential Access, Privilege Escalation, etc.).

## Architecture
- **Virtual Network (VNet)** â€“ Isolated network to host resources.  
- **Network Security Group (NSG)** â€“ Initially allowed inbound traffic for honeypot exposure.  
- **Virtual Machines** â€“ 2 Windows servers + 1 Linux server for attack surface.  
- **Log Analytics Workspace** â€“ Central log ingestion and storage.  
- **Azure Key Vault** â€“ Target resource for privilege escalation attempts.  
- **Azure Storage Account** â€“ Used for telemetry and attack logging.  
- **Microsoft Sentinel** â€“ SIEM/SOAR solution for detections and incidents.

## Provisioning & Resource Setup
- Deployed **2 Windows VMs** and **1 Linux VM** inside a single VNet.  
- Configured **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** with intentionally open inbound rules to simulate insecure conditions.  
- Provisioned **Azure Key Vault** for secret management.  
- Created **Storage Account & Containers** to archive and centralize logs.

### 2. Connecting to Sentinel
- Created a **Log Analytics Workspace**.  
- Connected resources and ingested logs into Sentinel.

### 3. Enabling Data Collection
- Set up **Data Collection Rules (DCRs)** to forward logs.  
- Verified logs were successfully ingested.

## ðŸŽ¯ Simulated Attacks

To generate realistic activity:
- Performed **brute force login attempts** from attacker VM.  
- Executed malicious commands on the Linux VM.
- Check logs for malicious activity.

## ðŸ“Š Sentinel Analytics & Workbooks  
- Queried logs with **KQL** to track brute-force attempts and event volume.  
- Created and enabled **analytics rules** for suspicious activity.  
- Built **workbooks** for real-time visualization.

## ðŸš¨ Incidents & Detection
- Sentinel successfully triggered **incidents** from simulated attacks.  
- Detected brute-force attempts and enriched them with attacker information.
